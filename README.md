Currently doing: **015**

## How use it

1. For a new day make a folder inside "Challenges" named as the correspondent day number. Don't forget to use 3 digits.
2. Copy index.html and styles.scss from the TEMPLATE folder to the new day challenge.
3. Start resolving the problem. Don't forget to edit the title of the page.

## TODO
